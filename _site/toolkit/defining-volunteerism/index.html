  <h2>Defining Volunteerism</h2>
  <div class='prose'>
    <p>We frequently use the following terms interchangeably when discussing service. Let's clarify with brief distinctions between each of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Advocacy</strong>- The Peace Corps describes advocacy as the process or act of supporting a cause. Ad-Voc-Acy means giving voice. See also the <a href="http://inside.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?viewDocument&amp;document_id=51289&amp;filetype=htm">Peace Corp's Advocacy Training Package</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Civic Education</strong> – Educating youth on different civic engagement activities, including 1. Participating in community problem solving, 2. Regular volunteering, 3. Active membership in groups or associations, 4. Participating in fund-raising activities, or 5. Engaging local officials or leaders in decision making.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Civic Engagement</strong> - Individual or collective actions to improve the wellbeing of communities or nations; can include a broad range of activities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Civic Service</strong> – An organized period of substantial engagement and contribution to the local, national, or world community, recognized and valued by society: with minimal monetary compensation to the participant</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community Engagement</strong> - Community or external sources of support including: family, teachers, leaders, peers, other caring adults such as coaches or mentors; supportive neighborhoods, their school environment, supporting organizations and programs; and safe places to spend free time. See also the <a href="http://inside.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?viewDocument&amp;document_id=56503">Community Engagement Tip Sheet</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>National Service</strong> –A structured civic service program hosted by the national government assigning volunteers to areas of defined need. See also the Volunteerism and Service Examples by Country.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service</strong> – Carrying out service to benefit others or one's community without the expectation of external rewards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Learning</strong> - Combines service objectives with learning objectives with the intent that the activity changes both the recipient and the provider of the service. Building in learning goals and reflection on the part of the participants distinguishes service-learning from other types of service. <a href="http://files.peacecorps.gov/multimedia/pdf/library/CD062_V2_English.pdf">The Volunteerism Action Guide: Multiplying the Power of Service</a> walks through the steps for Service Learning. See also the <a href="http://inside.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?viewDocument&amp;document_id=40597&amp;filetype=htm">Peace Corp's Volunteerism and Service Learning Training Package</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Volunteerism</strong> – Volunteerism is commonly and simply defined as voluntary (not required); unpaid; and benefiting others. For a more complete, definition, see the <a href="file://///dcna_cifs.peacecorps.gov/users/kscheuerer/Volunteerism/TAG/Volunteerism%20Toolkit/%EF%82%A7%09http:/www.unv.org/fileadmin/docdb/pdf/2011/SWVR/English/SWVR2011_full_%5b04%5d_chapter1.pdf">State of the World's Volunteerism Report</a>.
