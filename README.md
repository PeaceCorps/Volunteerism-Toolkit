The Volunteerism Toolkit is a repository for tools, resources, and best practices related to Volunteerism.

### What is this?

This Volunteerism Toolkit is intended to provide Peace Corps Staff and Volunteers with an accessible set of materials focused on promoting activities and trainings around volunteerism.

### How does this work?

The Toolkit hosts everything on a Github repository, making it easy to control versions, track contributions, and allow for the greatest scalability and flexibility of content.

### Roadmap

We are working on ways to automate versioning and for ensuring that up-to-date versions of this Toolkit are available in html, text, PDF, and e-reader versions.

### How to contribute (three ways)

##### 1. Create an Issue

If you find something you'd like to be fixed, (but you don't know exactly what should be fixed), have trouble following the documentation or have a question about the toolkit – [create an issue](https://github.com/PeaceCorps/volunteerism-toolkit/issues/new)! There’s nothing to it and whatever issue you’re having, you’re likely not the only one, so others will find your issue helpful, too. For more information on how issues work, check out Github's [Issues guide](http://guides.github.com/features/issues).

##### 2. Ask to become a collaborator

This toolkit is by and for everyone interested in Peace Corps' role in promoting Volunteerism. You can contact the maintainer(s) to become a contributing member so that you can contribute right on [Github](http://github.com) or through a third-party content editing platform such as [prose.io](http://prose.io)

##### 3. Pull Request

If you’re able to patch the documentation or add the material yourself – fantastic, make a pull request with the new content! Once you’ve submitted a pull request the maintainer(s) can compare your branch to the existing one and decide whether or not to incorporate (pull in) your changes.

###### Markdown

The files and links in this repository use a text format known as Markdown. Markdown uses regular alphanumeric characters to create text documents that have some formatting and is the preferred authoring method for GitHub documentation. It is quite easy to learn as this [10-minute tutorial demonstrates](http://markdowntutorial.com/).

###### Local Development

To work on the site locally, run `jekyll serve --watch`, then visit `http://localhost:4000/technology-for-development-toolkit/` in your browser.
